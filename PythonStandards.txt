PEP naming:
Objects - CamelCase
Globals - prefix underscore
Functions - lowercase with underscore 
	-> Internal functions should be prefixed with underscore
Constants - ALLCAPS


General Practices:
IMPORT STUFF

FUNCTIONS

OBJECTS

if __name__ == main():
	defined
	
	func1()
	func2()


Objects:
GUI elements -> standard library for setting up buttons and jazz (ipywidgets)
get properties involved (setters and getters)
Line breaks and naming arguments
