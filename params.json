  "body": "### Welcome to the Demos section of the PyCav Project.\r\nThis repository contains a set of demonstrations written within Python notebooks displaying interactive content from across the NST Physics courses. These could be used within lectures, practicals and supervisions to present the content, conveying the important aspects such as how the behaviour is altered by changing a certain parameter. The notebooks contain code, text, $\\LaTeX$ equations, plots and animations hence different perspectives can be emphasised e.g. the equations and figures can be highlighted with little emphasis placed on the code or vice verse.\r\n\r\n### Notebook Binder\r\nA set of Demo notebooks can be viewed within a browser without the need to download the file and have the program to run it. To proceed directly to our notebook binder, use the following link:\r\n[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org/repo/PyCav/Demos)\r\n",
